# Microcks Community

## Introduction
This repository is a space for discussing and debating various aspects of running the Microcks organization, how we function as a community, and our shared inspirations and expectations.

## Discussions and Discord

Reach out with any questions you may have, and we'll make sure to answer them as soon as possible. As a community member, feel free to jump in and answer questions. 

Microcks utilizes Discord and GitHub ([discussions](https://github.com/orgs/microcks/discussions) and [issues](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/issues)) to facilitate our communications, each serving unique purposes to support our community effectively.

Discord is the go-to for lively conversations, channel announcements, support, and immediate community assistance, making real-time communication seamless and efficient. However, Discord isn't ideal for housing detailed discussions, long-term planning, or tracking the evolution of ideas and decisions.

For more in-depth discussions, planning, and documenting significant decisions, we use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/issues). It allows us to work together more effectively on significant decisions and provides a long-standing point of reference for our discussions.
